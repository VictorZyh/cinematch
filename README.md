# CineMatch

CineMatch is a production-style, end-to-end movie recommendation system built on MovieLens.
The project focuses on clean machine-learning engineering: modular code, leakage-safe evaluation, reproducible training, unit tests, and a runnable pipeline.

The current model uses lightweight mainstream recommender components while staying within a simple pandas/numpy/sklearn stack. The architecture makes it easy to replace or improve candidate generation, ranking features, or the ranker later.

## What It Does

CineMatch trains and evaluates a two-stage recommender:

1. **Candidate generation**
   - Popularity-based retrieval
   - Item-item collaborative filtering with cosine nearest neighbors
   - Matrix-factorization retrieval with `sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD`
   - Weighted hybrid candidate merging

2. **Ranking**
   - Leakage-safe user, item, genre, and candidate-source features
   - Supervised sklearn ranker, with logistic regression as the current default
   - Optional `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` experiment path

3. **Evaluation**
   - Timestamp-based train/test split
   - Precision@K
   - Recall@K
   - nDCG@K
   - HitRate@K
   - Catalog coverage

## Why This Project Is Structured This Way

Industrial recommenders usually do not score every item for every user in one step. They first retrieve a smaller candidate set, then rank those candidates with richer features. CineMatch follows that pattern while keeping the implementation small enough to understand, test, and extend.

The split is time-based per user: each user's latest interactions are held out as future test data, while features and models are fit only on earlier interactions. This avoids the most common recommender-system data leakage mistake.

## Dataset

The default dataset is MovieLens Latest Small from GroupLens.

Expected files after download:

```text
data/raw/ml-latest-small/
├── ratings.csv
└── movies.csv
```

Download it with:

```bash
python scripts/download_movielens.py --dataset latest-small
```

The larger MovieLens latest dataset is also supported:

```bash
python scripts/download_movielens.py --dataset latest
```

Raw data is intentionally excluded from Git. The dataset is downloaded reproducibly from the official GroupLens file server.

## Quickstart

Create the environment and install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

Download the default dataset:

```bash
make download
```

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
make run
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Pipeline Output

The pipeline writes artifacts to:

```text
artifacts/
├── candidate_generator.pkl
├── feature_builder.pkl
├── metrics.json
├── ranker.pkl
├── recommendations.csv
├── run_metadata.json
└── train_interactions.pkl
```

Example command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/run_pipeline.py --config configs/default.json
```

- [Model card](docs/model_card.md)
- [Experiment report](docs/experiment_report.md)
- [Sample metrics](docs/sample_metrics.json)

Latest default MovieLens small run:

```text
Recall@10: 0.1129
Recall@20: 0.1653
nDCG@10:   0.0463
Coverage:  2684
```

## Batch Inference

After running the training pipeline, create a user file:

```bash
printf "1\n2\n3\n" > artifacts/users.txt
```

Generate recommendations from saved artifacts:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/batch_recommend.py \
  --artifact-dir artifacts \
  --user-file artifacts/users.txt \
  --output-path artifacts/batch_recommendations.csv \
  --top-k 10
```

Or use:

```bash
make recommend
```

## Current Test Status

Local validation:

```text
51 passed
Total coverage: 94.23%
```

The GitHub Actions workflow also runs the test suite on push and pull request.

## Design Principles

- No notebooks in the production path
- Only `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` for ML/data logic
- Modular components with clear ownership
- Explicit type hints and docstrings
- Leakage-safe feature computation
- Testable pure functions where possible
- Reproducible command-line pipeline

## Next Improvements

- Add feature importance and diagnostics
- Add stronger ranking models and better negative sampling
- Add experiment tracking with metrics history
- Add API serving once the offline pipeline stabilizes
